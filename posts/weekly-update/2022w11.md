You aren’t following all of the twitter accounts showcasing their .pcc.eth ens subdomain!  
To remedy this error click [**_here_**](https://twitter.com/search?q=.pcc.eth&src=typed_query&f=user) and smash the follow button!

Wait, you don’t have your own **.pcc.ens** subdomain?! Go [here](https://t.co/JEdQU6poUw) to fix that critical issue. Should you run into any issues please see our discord channel #lobby-bar lobby [here](https://discord.gg/pENe5hw828).

    This is your daily reminder that .pcc.eth is so much stronger on twitter dot
    com than a pfp because you can search for .pcc.eth
    <br />

**\~\~Back to our regularly scheduled weekly news and notes\~\~**

On Sunday 3/20/22 we co-hosted a poker night on [betonline.ag](https://www.betonline.ag/) with our friends at [Knights of Degen](https://twitter.com/knightsofdegen) and [Pieland](https://twitter.com/PielandNFT). The only way to play was to hold an Purr NFT (Cat or Kitten), Knight of Degen or Pieland so be sure to [pick one up](https://opensea.io/collection/purrnelopes-country-club) if you haven’t yet!

The KittyVault has been on an absolute tear lately, up to a 998.51 ETH floor valuation as of Friday March 18th. This is a 67.5 ETH increase week over week and a sneak peek into the future, the vote to sell the KittyVault’s $APE airdrop [**passed**](https://snapshot.org/#/purrnelopescountryclub.eth/proposal/0x6f1a3689060cfb7dcb5f1bc90b526de943b72af2926a528fbfa0f62c7c386691) with 76.92% of voters voting YES. Next up we’ll have a vote on what to do with the ETH we sell the $APE for so get in our discord and share your ideas!
