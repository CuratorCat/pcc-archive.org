1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Carlini8: There wasn't any
opportunity like there is now

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,940
where you can take Ethereum, do
stuff with it and have more

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,600
Ethereum. That's generally what
people in the NFT space are

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,170
doing. They're trying to make
ETH. Most tokens aren't launched

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,590
legally. And I think that will
be a big problem for projects as

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,530
well. Because, like I've said
earlier, the team is the

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,460
important bit, you know, pretty
much the outside image of your

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,670
NFT project right now is all
about Twitter. And this is just

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,110
a very powerful way to get your
community interacting more on

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,310
Twitter. Every community with
this would interact more.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,268
Valerio: What's up everyone?
Welcome to a another show

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,700
another episode on the
Talkenized Show. I'm your host,

13
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:47,820
Valerio. I'm here with Konrad.
What's up? Konrad?

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,530
Konrad: Hi, hello.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,320
Valerio: And I'm very happy for
today's episode, because today's

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,200
guest is a OG. He's been into
the NFT space since four years

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,700
now since 2017. And he's the
founder of the Purrnelope's

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,880
Country Club. What's up, James?
What's up Carlini? Thank you so

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,980
much for taking the time and
joining us today.

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,630
Carlini8: All right. Thanks for
having me on.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,460
Konrad: I'm super, super happy
to have you, man and to talk

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,450
about your background and about
your current project and about

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,110
your general view on web three.
So to get started, Carlini, can

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,500
you give us a short introduction
for anyone who doesn't know you

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,570
yet? Well? Who are you and what
you do right now?

26
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,880
Carlini8: Yeah, sure. So Carlini
8. I've been in NFTs since 2017.

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:50,850
crypto. I'm not actually sure,
because I mined very briefly

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,960
some bitcoin. And all I know is
I did it in my old house, which

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,360
I lived in 2013 2015. And that's
a few that had drovers a few

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,280
weeks ago. And I kind of got
trolled out of mining Bitcoin,

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,490
because I was told, Oh, you're,
you're a millionaire. Yeah. And

32
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,930
then I checked, like, overnight,
I'd mined 4 P worth of bitcoin

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,120
at the time or something like
that. Four pence, probably about

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,500
six cents.

35
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,540
Konrad: You mined six cents
worth of bitcoin,

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,180
Carlini8: overnight, like every
night, I guess So I, I used my

37
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,620
gaming PC to mine. And it was
when I wasn't using it, you

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,120
know, it's just like idly mining
overnight. And it was not very

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,270
powerful. So it didn't do much,
but it was probably at the time

40
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:47,470
costing me costing me money and
electricity. But that that hard

41
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,650
drive was wiped many times and
it wouldn't have been much. And

42
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:58,780
then 2015 is where my smaller
purchases started happening in

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,630
crypto. And I was mainly when I
when I started getting bigger

44
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,600
buyers, I was mainly interested
in ETH just because I like that

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,980
you can do stuff like you know,
bitcoins great for starting all

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,240
of this and for what it
represents and what it can do.

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,040
monetarily, but that that didn't
really interest me and never

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,840
brought me in it was more the
the utility I guess of Ethereum.

49
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,210
They're just hooked me in and
full, full blown degens since

50
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,800
2017, pretty much

51
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,290
Konrad: all right. So so what
what are you doing at the

52
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:43,800
moment?

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,290
Carlini8: So currently I run
Purrnelope's Country Club. It's

54
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:58,990
a 10k PFP NFT projects. But
we're just trying to I guess do

55
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,880
it right. So I've been in NFTs.
Pretty much since you know, they

56
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,450
weren't mainstream. There are a
couple couple projects before I

57
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,030
came in, but certainly not many
people. So I've seen how NFTs

58
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,240
have changed and where we expect
them to go. And back in 2017. We

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,210
had where we expected them to
go. And we've sort of seen how

60
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,460
we've progressed towards that.
And I just want to sort of

61
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,480
utilize the technology with a
project as best as possible,

62
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,350
which I guess are our main
current utility we have that

63
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,310
shows that our Fiza ens
subdomains where each cat is

64
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,760
able to claim a dot PCC dot ETH
domain for free, which is just

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,480
like an ens domain instead of
dot ETH. You get .pcc.eth But

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,260
it's also free because you get
it from us who have paid for it

67
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:07,300
PCC dot ETH. And that becomes
your wallet. And it can be it

68
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,100
can turn your username into a
profile picture. And just even

69
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,280
little things like I can't
search for all of the users on

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,700
Twitter who have a Purrnelope's
as Country Club profile picture.

71
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,250
But I can search .pcc.eth go
click on people, and it shows me

72
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,470
everyone that has that in their
name. So it's, we we've actually

73
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,350
got something coming that sort
of links that to discord as

74
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,230
well. And that will just be
showing even more. So how this,

75
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,190
this can be pushed, because
you've effectively got your

76
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,830
digital identity linked over
Ethereum, Twitter and discord.

77
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,810
And we can do lots of things.
Once that's all linked up. Yep.

78
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,000
Konrad: And can you link your
NFT to any social media profile

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,780
like Facebook, Instagram, and so
on, or limited by something?

80
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,640
Carlini8: When I say linked,
it's bad centralized, I guess.

81
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,790
So that's not on Ethereum. And
that's with a bot, were able to

82
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,750
search using the Twitter API,
they just got API, and then

83
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,040
Ethereum to check the subdomain.
So for what we're planning to

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,800
do, you could you could probably
do the same for Instagram and

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Facebook, but it would just be
integrating with their APIs.

86
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,580
Konrad: All right. Makes sense.

87
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,310
All right. When did you guys
start with with PCC with the

88
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,910
project?

89
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,680
Carlini8: We started building it
towards the end of March last

90
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,720
year. So we started over a year
ago now, but we mint. I think we

91
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,670
started minted in June.

92
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,990
Konrad: All right, how did the
launch go? How to demand go.

93
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,000
Carlini8: It was slow, because
at the time, we were completely

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,190
anonymous. Because I was working
for NFT boxes before it started

95
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,960
NFT boxes were my co founder
Pranksy December 2020. And I

96
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,390
ended up in March selling my
half of NFT boxes to him. But

97
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,350
that was there was lots of sort
of legal loopholes, we had to

98
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,240
jump through and all these sort
of things. So ended up taking

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,300
maybe four months to sort that
out. And I didn't think it was

100
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,810
the right two people at the time
for what I was working on NFT

101
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,730
boxes, we couldn't tell them why
I wasn't or that I wasn't. So it

102
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,420
didn't seem right that we were
like, Hey, I'm launching this as

103
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,280
well. So we're anonymous until
the sale was confirmed. And as

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,910
soon as the NFT boxes sale was
confirmed. We unanoned as a team

105
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,560
said, Hey, this is us. We sold
out in a couple of hours.

106
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,050
Konrad: And how did you
initially come up with an idea

107
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,280
of PCC? Was it your own idea? Or
did you have a team because it.

108
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:16,590
Carlini8: So we are a team of
three of us at the start. One

109
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,030
who had come from Box NFT boxes
with me, the community manager

110
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,190
who was part time but wanted
sort of a full time stable job

111
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,640
because this was I guess, not
bang in the middle of lockdowns

112
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,650
and COVID. But they were sort of
coming back it was January to

113
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:45,840
March 2021, you know, a bit
unstable and just wanted to be

114
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,820
locked down in in a solid job.
So that wasn't something I could

115
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,840
offer NFT boxes, someone else
who I was going to bring over to

116
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,150
NFT boxes is to sort of sort
that side of things out as well,

117
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,970
who I got to quit a job brought
him with me. So that's 3.

118
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,460
And we originally had a couple
of ideas on what we wanted to do

119
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,680
was take my side of NFT boxes, I
worked with the community and

120
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,540
sort of made made the things
work, I guess, like the website

121
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,920
and the contracts, I'd find the
right people for that. And we

122
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,290
wanted to make sure it's
community focused. And our

123
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,210
original idea was sort of to try
and help creators. Like you guys

124
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,460
have a podcast, we would come in
with some sort of NFT rewards

125
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,830
that would kind of build in
Patreon or Twitch subscriptions.

126
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,500
You know how to Twitch their
badges after six months in a

127
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,670
year and two and three years.
Why aren't they NFTs? So we're

128
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,590
gonna go down that line. And I
told these two guys, like, I'll

129
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,270
fund it for a year and we'll see
where we are Ah, and we were

130
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,580
sort of going down that route.
And then someone said, How are

131
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,470
we going to make money? So I
don't know. Hopefully find it.

132
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,240
If he said, at the end of the
year, what happens? Do I have to

133
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,320
find a job, I don't believe
properly unless you know, we've

134
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,090
got VC funding or get bought out
or something like that. And he's

135
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,480
like, I want to make money. I
want, I want this to be a job.

136
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,710
And by I want to make money,
that's more I want that to be a

137
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:37,040
salary for me. So we just
looked, you know, the matter at

138
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,150
the time was 10k, PFP. And then
we sort of amended our plans

139
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,670
like, right, how can we take the
10k PFP and push that towards

140
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:54,230
community and sort of, in effect
doing it right. And you can see

141
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,850
sort of on chain, how we've
spent the Ethereum from the

142
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,680
original sale, most of which
went into a kitty vault now

143
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,540
worth over 1000 Ethereum, which
is 200 ETH of more than our

144
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,420
wholesale. So we've sort of
created this community pot

145
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,930
that's bigger than all of the
money we've taken in, which sort

146
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,030
of just shows it's not a meant
and make us rich, it's a meant

147
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,590
and build for the community.

148
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,170
Konrad: All right. They
understand. Previously, you

149
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,040
mentioned your launch, right.
Your initial launch was in May

150
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,910
last year, right.

151
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,220
Carlini8: I'm kind of guessing.
I was a couple of seconds. And

152
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,480
go to a call. It was 269 days
ago.

153
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,900
Konrad: Wow. Almost a year.
Right?

154
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,540
Carlini8: Almost 269 days ago,
please help me get it was 17 for

155
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,080
July

156
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,570
Valerio: 25. July. Alright.

157
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,700
Oh, quickly. Did you sell out?

158
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:10,640
Carlini8: It took about a month,
I'd say. So it was just very

159
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,620
slowly minting until I was able
to because I was originally

160
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,280
Topcat Topcat was running the
project. And then as soon as

161
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,880
Carlini eight was running the
project, it minted it out in a

162
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,870
few hours. Think it was about a
month between those times.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,660
Konrad: All right. What do you
mean by running the project?

164
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,540
What did you do differently than
than top cat?

165
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,810
Carlini8: I was just called top
cat. I couldn't be me. I

166
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,260
couldn't

167
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,600
Valerio: think of all the
anonymity and the public name, I

168
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,410
guess. All right.

169
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Carlini8: So people knew they
weren't going to get well. They

170
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,470
don't know that I'm going to get
wrote quite a high chance that

171
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:56,160
you know, my my main wallet has
16,000 transactions. It's been

172
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,750
there 1400 days or something
like that. And not once in that

173
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,650
time have I scammed anyone. So
at that point, you know,

174
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,920
interesting. quite confident.

175
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,430
Konrad: How many pieces Did you
sell before you announced that

176
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,150
you are you?

177
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,330
Carlini8: Maybe 2000?

178
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,230
Konrad: Okay, because my
question is that at that time,

179
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,850
there were a lot of profile pic
projects where a lot of them had

180
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,600
anonymous team and how did you
manage the community to like

181
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,930
stay organized because I've been
on many discourage during the

182
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,110
time and if a project didn't
sell out in like a day or two

183
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,410
people were just panicking all
over the place and claim it as a

184
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
total scam.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,220
Carlini8: I think I think how
that plays out is generally how

186
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,900
do you get a get the community
in the first place? So like,

187
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,200
like I said, we were trying to
do it right. So we weren't

188
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,520
paying people to promote us
weren't paying for tweets. We

189
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,320
weren't, you know, sneakily,
underhand, well, maybe not even

190
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,210
underhand, but given these alpha
groups, you know, couple of ETH

191
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,240
like, Hey, you start minting you
start minting we'll give you

192
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
this ETH that ETH you'll get
everything half price or

193
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,560
whatever. They start minting
sets off some alerts other

194
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,390
people start minting some
projects, even their own, their

195
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:26,090
own NFT is you know, they just
get a few 100 ETH mint a few

196
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,040
1000 yourself sets off the
alerts yourself. Away you go.

197
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,580
You're just giving yourself
money effectively at that point

198
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,430
with a little bit of gas fees.
Oh, well. So we were just

199
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,930
totally you know, I guess
upfront, not paying for hype.

200
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,120
And I've seen quite a lot of
people trying to do it you know,

201
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,140
that way and struggle if you
don't follow the matter of the

202
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,980
time. You will you will find it
hard in this space because there

203
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,300
are some excellent marketers
They've come into this space.

204
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,630
And the problem is that's really
where their talents lie. Maybe

205
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,300
one or two people on the team
are just really good at creating

206
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,480
the hype and marketing. But then
there's no one to execute once

207
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,810
is minted. And we're just seeing
so many so many projects, I

208
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,600
think a couple of months ago, I
looked back at a certain day,

209
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,340
last year, I think it was the
day it was it was a year before.

210
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,660
And there were these calendar
projects that used to just put

211
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,080
out here, today's mints, and I
just looked at every project,

212
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:45,620
and two was still active. Ish.
One, I kind of ignored art

213
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,260
blocks because there was an art
block summit that day. And in

214
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,310
reality, that's just art and art
blocks is a platform. But

215
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,420
everything else there was was
maybe nine or 10 projects that

216
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,090
hadn't tweeted this year, there
was no discord activity, maybe

217
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,500
half of them their websites were
deleted. But the one the one

218
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,470
year, the one year renewal of
their website hadn't been

219
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,250
continued.

220
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,960
Konrad: Alright. So what makes
it project being like long term

221
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,020
because I would say that if
you're running it for a year

222
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,260
now, we can call the success
because as you said, like you've

223
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,860
seen many projects starting the
same day and just dying out. So

224
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,010
how do you survive for this
market, which is, I wouldn't say

225
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,470
saturated, but there are a lot
of new projects coming in every

226
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,020
day. And there's huge noise in
the space.

227
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,890
Carlini8: It's it is the team,
at the end of the day, because

228
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,870
if the team keep building, that
project is still alive, the may

229
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,490
not be many holders, the floor
may be basically zero. But when

230
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,720
they can tweet, something, like
we've been here, two years

231
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,650
building, we've done this, that
and the other, the the only

232
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,360
problems can come down to their
funding, if if they just you

233
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,770
know, end up having to, if they
just gotta go get a job, because

234
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,610
this, this project isn't paying
them or whatever. But as long as

235
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,360
the team are going to stay
around the there's always a

236
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,040
chance, right? So the projects
where the teams leave, they're

237
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,240
done. They like they just can't
be revived. There's no reason I

238
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,710
know, there are NFTs and anyone
can spin up a site and build a

239
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,160
game around that NFT that
they've said that says the

240
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,820
crypto kitties days, it was like
build, they even back then they

241
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,470
tried to pay people to build on
top of crypto kitties, very

242
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,290
small amounts compared to now
because you know, the money

243
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,830
involved in crypto was so much
lower than but they, it just, it

244
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,860
just never works. Because why
would anyone put in a lot of

245
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,790
effort for someone else's
product, when if they're going

246
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,330
to build something, they could
just sell their own their own

247
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,980
avatars, or land or whatever it
is that works within the game

248
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:14,410
card games. And it's just very
tricky to make that work. So

249
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,060
really, the lifeblood of every
NFT project is running like a

250
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,710
business. Because the will of
course, be art, you know,

251
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,510
artists aren't expected to do,
you know, make a game or

252
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,450
anything like that. They just
keep creating art. And it's very

253
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,900
much its own category. But I'm
talking about the projects that

254
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,680
should be run as a company. If
the team keep going, they can

255
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,490
always build a community around
it, it's it's harder. It's

256
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,250
always easiest at mint because
you get in, you build up that

257
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,590
height because Mint is coming.
But the the rugs will be when

258
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,920
when a team member leaves when
the team leaves, it's it's just

259
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,520
done at this at this period of
time, maybe, you know, maybe in

260
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,170
five years time, maybe even
less, we'll see we'll see time

261
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,760
where a community really has
built up around a project. And

262
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,810
they can survive without a team.
All right, but we're not there

263
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,020
yet.

264
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,460
Konrad: And even if the team
like comes back, like a couple

265
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,490
of weeks after because that's
what what we're seeing with some

266
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,950
of the projects that are not
started like this year 2022 that

267
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,480
the team is gone. And then like
a month later, like the founders

268
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,980
is saying on Twitter. Hello
guys. I'm back. Let's do it

269
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,080
again. But I guess it's not the
same anymore. Right.

270
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,930
Carlini8: And I'm sure that
definitely has nothing to do

271
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,860
with the guys who have gone to
prison for a few years for

272
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,100
effectively just straight
rocking. So oh, if we if we

273
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,360
quickly go back now maybe they
won't think we wrote them and we

274
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,440
were just incompetent.

275
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,890
Konrad: It's true that he
announced his comeback like a

276
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,800
couple of days afterwards. Yeah,
it was fun. Um But what exactly

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,730
do you mean by, you know,
keeping a project life? What do

278
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,510
you mean by by building? How do
you do keep the project alive?

279
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,790
That's the main question do you
focus on, on providing value in

280
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,680
some way providing utility on a
on a long term basis constantly?

281
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,350
Or how do you keep a project
alive?

282
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,570
And all that sort of thing,
because usually, when you start

283
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,750
a project you've had you have
the vision, and the direction

284
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,110
you want to go into. And you can
call the donor Combinator, like

285
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,290
milestones. So if you accomplish
them, how do you come up with

286
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,540
new ideas that you want to
execute?

287
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,680
Carlini8: Well in for new goals
in this space, normally, it's

288
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,200
just, you know, spend 1819 hours
a day on Twitter. And then as

289
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,430
soon as some cool new stuff
happens, you see it and you're

290
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,810
like, right, how can I? Can we
use that? Can we improve that.

291
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:06,510
So even even just recently, OWL
from cyberkongz, the Dev has

292
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,250
released a guardian contract,
which is effectively unchained

293
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,150
two factor authentification, you
can set it up so that you can

294
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,370
have your NFT in a hot wallet.
But you can only move it or do

295
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,530
certain things with it. If you
then sign a transaction from a

296
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,860
different hardware wallet, which
means you can use it in a game.

297
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,400
But you can't be scammed out of
that NFT, unless you go to your

298
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,130
hardware wallet that you've
locked away. And you you know,

299
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,440
you put somewhere far enough
away that while you're walking

300
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,520
to it, you think should I really
be doing this is this person

301
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,200
really not stealing my ape. So
you just got to be ready for

302
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,060
whatever that new next thing is.
I think NFT worlds have changed

303
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,730
that as well. Just because
they're building effectively on

304
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,330
the most played game in history,
Minecraft, they're sort of the

305
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,950
underlying layer. But the battle
hardened code that's underneath

306
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,220
it, they've added their own
token, and they're allowing

307
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,350
communities to come around a
game effectively, the game that

308
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,290
has to be built by the devs. So
that's another angle lots of

309
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,680
projects. Now we're building a
game in NFT worlds are all of

310
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,450
these different sort of ones
that are building up. But in it,

311
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,270
the I guess the answer is always
different for different

312
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,450
projects, because they will all
have their own little different

313
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:37,380
goals. And for us, it's to use
that NFT to the best of its

314
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,630
ability. So I do think the ens
thing that I'd mentioned

315
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,340
earlier, I think that's one of
the greatest NFT utilities at

316
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,300
the moment. And it is kind of
confusing to me why everyone

317
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,190
isn't copying us. I would just
expect people to see it. I know

318
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,300
we're quite small, like not
diluted that you know, we're one

319
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,990
of the projects that people will
be keeping eyes on all the time.

320
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,740
But it it should have, I feel
like he should have twigged in a

321
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,680
couple of founders minds maybe
it's just not high on their

322
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,990
priority list and it's on their
to do list or whatever. But

323
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:24,060
really, whatever the project is
building to so if you're if it's

324
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,920
a story we've seen with cyber
brokers, they've had missions

325
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,210
over the past week every day,
and that's built up to a reward

326
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,520
which I think is a mecca arm but
that's clearly then building to

327
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,850
something so there's some kind
of story going on their bored

328
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,230
apes are coming out with their
land azuki did their in real

329
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,810
life. Check your wallets drop.
doodles going down the non

330
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:01,080
dilutive, non dilutive, get
everyone in somehow route which

331
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,770
is going to be very interesting
to see how they do that. So it's

332
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,310
just all these projects coming
up with their own ways to bring

333
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,350
value to their community. And
when there's a winner, I think

334
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,240
we'll see a lot of people
following

335
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,400
Konrad: all right, what by the
way, what what do you think is

336
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,650
the biggest advantage of holding
a .pcc.eth domain like what what

337
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,480
makes you so so confident that
you're wondering yourself why

338
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,770
other founders haven't?

339
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:39,100
Carlini8: It's it's not
.pcc.eeth. It's dot anything dot

340
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,380
Eve. So I'm not saying dot PCC
dot ETH is the greatest thing

341
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:52,330
ever. I'm saying the concept
itself is great. For example, we

342
00:24:52,330 --> 00:25:00,910
see we see new ba YC new azuki
with founders Every day, they're

343
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:05,740
all verified. They're all
tagging us on Twitter. If their

344
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:13,810
username was.ba yc.eth
something.ba, YC dot eth. That

345
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,350
would be unchained verification
that they're real. It's a bit

346
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,870
like the hexagon on Twitter. But
it's a username. So it would, it

347
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,620
will cut out that sort of
scamming. And you don't need to

348
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,590
ask them for their wallet. So if
you're doing a deal with someone

349
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,910
that's pretending to be whatever
dot bayc dot eth, and they say,

350
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,510
oh, actually send it to this
other wallet, that should set

351
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,230
off alarm bells, because they've
publicly said this is their

352
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,950
wallet. Why are they wanting to
send this somewhere else? It's

353
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,630
clearly a scam. And it's, it's
just the other integration as

354
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,490
well. So we were going to be
able to give people a slight

355
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,190
nudge to use dot PCC dot ETH on
Discord and Twitter. And that

356
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,030
itself is powerful marketing.
For a project like us, it would

357
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,030
be even bigger for a bigger
project, if suddenly you have

358
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,170
like, there's no doubt in my
mind that if bored apes did it

359
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,120
before 1000 people on Twitter
with Dot BaYC, dot Eth, within a

360
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,230
week. And just seeing those all
over Twitter, the ability to

361
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,500
search, eight, follow eight
would be so much stronger. And

362
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,910
right now, NFTs are marketing
really, when we when we get down

363
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,240
to it.

364
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,590
Konrad: But why would I not be
able to just change my username,

365
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,210
for example, also to dot, I
don't know to Valerio dot baYC

366
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:40,780
dot eth

367
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:43,679
Carlini8: like that won't work.

368
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,830
Konrad: But for Twitter, to
change your username, you don't

369
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,250
need to link it to your wallet,
right? It's only for the hexagon

370
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,640
profile.

371
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,010
Carlini8: I'm fully expecting
some form down the line with

372
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,700
Twitter a verification. So you
know how they've recently added

373
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,020
the links with the little blue
ticks. If they're a real link,

374
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,690
they verify that links aren't a
scam. Alright.

375
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,190
Konrad: I'm not sure if I knew a
bit about this,

376
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,140
Carlini8: it's pretty new a few
days, I've just got Twitter

377
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,500
open. So I'll just send you I
haven't seen as well in the

378
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,330
discord. Just next to links,
there's a green circle with a

379
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:35,750
white ticket. And I fully expect
they are able to verify that an

380
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,310
NFT you own an NFT. And it
shouldn't be too much of a leap

381
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:46,550
for them to be able to verify
that you own a subdomain. So I

382
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:51,230
think very quickly that will
become a searchable proof of

383
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:57,740
ownership because you can only
have that if you own for us you

384
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,610
can only have dot PCC dot ETH if
you own a Purrnelope, and you

385
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:06,470
cannot fake like with an NFT.
You can you can just mentor

386
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,800
bored ape and get a hexagon. You
can you know you can just mentor

387
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,670
on open see just a picture of it
is obviously fake. But Twitter

388
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,020
will verify exists an NFT.
Whereas we've got PCC dot ETH

389
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,150
you cannot verify that the only
way to verify it is by actually

390
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,600
having it. So when that when
their version of a hexagon be

391
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,720
that a tick or I don't know,
colorful semi circle around it

392
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,220
or something like that. That
will be sort of the gold

393
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,920
standard of not getting scammed,
I think.

394
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,620
Konrad: All right, interesting.
So So basically, you think that

395
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,300
in some time that it's possible
to change your username, I mean,

396
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,480
similar to the profile pic,
right? Where you connect to your

397
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,870
wallet, and then obviously the
domain. I mean, it's everything

398
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,290
on chain, right? So it's easy to
prove, and verify if you

399
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,400
actually own it. And then you're
actually able to change your

400
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,410
user name to whatever if you own
whatever domain you own, similar

401
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,180
to the profile pic. Alright.

402
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
Carlini8: And that's sort of
short term thinking as well. If

403
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,110
you go, you know, long term, pie
in the sky, which often people

404
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,220
talk about when thinking about
NF. TS, you know, logging into

405
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,930
your email with your subdomain,
your your web free version of

406
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,370
email, whatever that is logging
into Facebook, Instagram, even

407
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,150
Twitter itself. This could be
done via your wallet. And your

408
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:45,090
wallet is your subdomain. It's
snow. It's how your wallet is

409
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:51,330
represented, I guess. But you
will be logging in as this. This

410
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,870
subdomain for everything in the
long term.

411
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,490
Konrad: i It's very interesting
because I was always asking

412
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,630
myself I could just as you said
earlier, I could use CTRL S like

413
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,140
a bored eight, right? Safe,
safety picture and just just

414
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,790
meant it. And then I own the
NFT. It's not the official one,

415
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,080
but I still own on the NFT and
can upload it to as a hexagon on

416
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,210
Twitter. And on the first site,
it's a bored ape. Right? And I

417
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,020
don't think all people, I don't
think everyone actually clicks

418
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,160
on it, and then scrolls down and
checks if all right, it's the

419
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,430
official collection and stuff.
Usually, it's just the first for

420
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,810
sidebar people are

421
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,220
Carlini8: never I've never
checked a hexagon, ever. I've

422
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,430
never, I didn't even know you
didn't know you could. So now

423
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,170
I'm having to scroll. And yeah,

424
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,660
Konrad: I did a couple of times,
but I don't think I'm I think

425
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:52,150
I'm the minority. But yeah. I
mean, most people are lazy, so

426
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,550
so that they will just see the
bored ape. And they're like,

427
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,460
alright, it's official one. But
but that's super, super cool,

428
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,120
actually. And I've never thought
about that. Well. So I guess

429
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,080
we'll see it. Soon that other
projects start implemented

430
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,920
something like this,

431
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,130
Carlini8: we were already kind
of alpha, I guess we're already

432
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,130
confirming real Twitter
Usernames, we have a bot coming.

433
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,270
haven't actually no one in the
community knows. So this is, you

434
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,050
know, fresh info for them. But
there's a bot coming that will

435
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,900
check discord, check Twitter,
and check the subdomains

436
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,920
registered. And if they all
match, you will be able to get a

437
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,510
role in the discord. And also,
there'll be a leaderboard that

438
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,630
shows how many of these verified
people you follow. So in a way,

439
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,020
you're pushing, you know, ape
follow ape, there's no way

440
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,380
there's no reason to put that
tweet out. Because we literally

441
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,680
have this leaderboard, showing
who we're incentivizing people

442
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,850
to go and follow the rest of the
community. And that just, you

443
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,660
know, pretty much the outside
image of your NFT project right

444
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,310
now is all about Twitter. And
this is just a very powerful way

445
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,550
to get your community
interacting more on Twitter,

446
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,670
every community with this would
interact more. So our

447
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,450
percentage, you know, might be
quite small, and we're starting

448
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,310
from a small place. But again,
as a concept, if doodles did

449
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:30,200
this, how, how much would that
explain the community? You know,

450
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,220
these sorts of things?

451
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,810
Konrad: Interesting. Yeah. I
don't know if you have anything

452
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,370
to add here, but do you

453
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,520
know, no, I just wanted to move
to another topic. If we're long

454
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:44,940
with it.

455
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:49,439
I would like to talk a little
bit about the background first.

456
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,800
Valerio: So finally, yeah, yeah,
sure. It's

457
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,290
Konrad: alright. Yeah, so your
background Carlini. So you said

458
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,050
you got into crypto 2013 started
mining on your gaming PC? What?

459
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,620
How old were you at the time?
2014.

460
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,160
Carlini8: If I had to guess it
was probably 2014 as was mining,

461
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,060
I was in that house 2013 2015.
And it was probably in the

462
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,000
middle of 2014. I was 24. It's
easier, just add 10 to the

463
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,930
whatever you were in.

464
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,840
Konrad: Alright, all right. And
like what background did you

465
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,020
have before that? Do you do you
have a college degree do you do

466
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,580
come from a technical
background?

467
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,620
Carlini8: So I went to I went to
uni and I did maths and biology.

468
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,650
After I graduated, I went to a
DNA testing company, using the

469
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:49,730
biology side of things for a few
years. But while I was there, I

470
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:58,010
started gambling in my spare
time, and it was gambling with

471
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,250
its it started off with
something called match betting

472
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,610
where you you kind of play the
odds. And no matter what

473
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,510
happens, you make a profit you
you bet on every outcome. And

474
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,770
you know, I talked about that
for hours but in a way I gambled

475
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:18,050
for a living in a way that is
mathematically viable. It wasn't

476
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,950
I wasn't a degen and I was I was
actually running a business. And

477
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,270
that got so big that I was
actually losing money going to

478
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:30,320
work. So I had to I had to say
to my boss I look I'm sorry,

479
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,780
I've got a quick I used I kept
getting like promoted and moved

480
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,500
up all right.

481
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,060
Konrad: But again, again, you
need to go more into detail. So

482
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,250
that was after after graduating
college uni and then working for

483
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,240
a DNA DNA company and then next
to that you start a gambling

484
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,630
match match betting what exactly
how does it work?

485
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:01,260
Carlini8: So, in I guess in a
quick rundown Is gambling

486
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,800
companies want you to gamble
with them, there's a lot of

487
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,790
competition to gamble. So they
want you to pick them over any

488
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,090
of their competitors. So they
give you an offer, hey, deposit

489
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,410
100 pounds, and we'll give you
100 pounds of fake money. And

490
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,080
you have to do a certain amount
of gambling until you can

491
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,520
withdraw any money. So I use the
math side of things to figure

492
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,930
out, right is this offer worth
doing. So I've put in 100

493
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,580
pounds, I now have 200 pounds,
but I have to gamble 2000

494
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,690
pounds. So I worked out if I
should, if I would make money

495
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,880
doing that. And normally, they
would make it profitable for

496
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,150
you. Because even without you
thinking about it, if you were

497
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,320
just gambling on random stuff,
they're making it so that you

498
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,360
should win originally, you get
hooked. And then eventually you

499
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,900
give it all back and more to
them. So that's their play. So

500
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,940
they, they effectively try and
make you win early. hook you in.

501
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,520
So horrible practice is really
destroyed some lives. But if you

502
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,540
just take the good part of that
offer, if you take the bit where

503
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,430
they're making it so that you
should win, and then leave and

504
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,860
then repeat with another company
and then repeat with another

505
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,130
company. And then you know, just
keep keep going. And that was

506
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,140
effectively where it all
started. And then that grew into

507
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,620
quite a big business. All right,
quit I quit my job in 2015 and

508
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,220
was a gambler until effectively
COVID.

509
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,400
Konrad: So karma really were you
making per month as a

510
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,420
professional gambler.

511
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:48,120
Carlini8: It did vary based on
the we're always December was

512
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,690
always a good month, because
companies would put out

513
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,040
effectively advent calendars
where every day, they would put

514
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,040
out an offer. And it was really
busy because he had to go

515
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,740
through all the sites and figure
out which company had actually

516
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,530
put out a good offer and which
one a terrible offer. Because

517
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,870
they weren't all just because
their offers didn't mean they

518
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:13,140
were worth doing. And also
throughout the time period. I

519
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:19,110
was I got progressively better
at it. But at the same time the

520
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,930
gambling companies made it
harder and harder. So it's like

521
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,490
an all way always a battle to
innovate and sort of move on. I

522
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,900
my peak, I was probably making
50,000 pounds a month

523
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,570
Konrad: how many dollars are
that? Approximately?

524
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:47,490
Carlini8: 70,000 pounds 65.
Almost exactly. 65. And that's

525
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,480
because that's gambling as well
in the UK gambling is tax free.

526
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,900
Which is a shame that crypto and
NFTs are classed as gambling

527
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,960
because I'll tell you if you're
listening Boris or Rishi, I am

528
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,500
gambling

529
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,010
Konrad: and how many hours a day
were we working on your gambling

530
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,380
Carlini8: It was quite it was
quite a lot it was. So I was in

531
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,310
business?

532
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,920
the mindset that I wouldn't get
another opportunity like this in

533
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,510
life and I really had to you
know, really grasp it while I

534
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,580
could. So I was I was working.
You know, most of the time

535
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,410
before I had kids, it was you
know the only other thing I

536
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:35,090
really did was spend time with
my wife and sometimes sometimes

537
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,690
go out and then when I had kids
I did it less because I spend

538
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,790
more time with them. That's
another good thing I was always

539
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:48,290
at home to to help out and see
them. But yeah, the mindset was

540
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,130
work all the time. But obviously
I had lazy periods. But I just

541
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,660
wanted to go for it while I
could. But slowly NFTs kind of

542
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:06,200
took over so I was I was
gambling during 2017 NFTs 2018

543
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,540
NFTs 2019 NFTs because the money
just wasn't really there. Like

544
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,740
the the NFT market you guys have
experienced I would have never

545
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:20,600
kept gambling. If that was what
it was like it was so bad that I

546
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,170
was making I was making money
gambling to put into NFTs

547
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,590
because I believed in NFTs but I
was not making money in NFTs

548
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,100
Konrad: I mean it makes sense
for you to squeeze out

549
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,000
everything you could but at what
point and how do you find about

550
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:40,920
crypto because if you're working
all the time, like how did you

551
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,400
find it?

552
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,940
Carlini8: I found it when I
found gambling ish when I found

553
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,690
match betting because I was
always you know, I don't even

554
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,500
really fully know how I found
match betting. So I did the

555
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,380
match betting concept on my own
just before I sort of found it I

556
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,040
did it. And I was like, this
should be a thing. So I kind of

557
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,960
went looking, found it. And at
the same time, people were using

558
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,940
Bitcoin to move money around. So
I'd done some research into

559
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,760
crypto. But the thing about
crypto then is you could only

560
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,800
really to make to make money two
or three ways you could trade.

561
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,900
And I was not a trader, and
trading takes losses to learn,

562
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,430
you could found and, you know, I
just found crypto, I couldn't

563
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,370
build something or raise any
money or do anything like that.

564
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,290
Or you could just hold it. And
that's just parking money. And

565
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,640
you're always just hoping it
goes up. Obviously, you can go

566
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,540
back in time, and no, it goes
up. But there wasn't any

567
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,110
opportunity like there is now
where you can take ethereum do

568
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:58,100
stuff with it and have more
Ethereum i That's generally what

569
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,620
people in the NFT space are
doing. They're trying to make

570
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,700
ETH, which you couldn't do back
then you couldn't I mean, some

571
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:10,790
people did. But it wasn't
common. So I always knew of

572
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:16,130
crypto when a couple of days ago
guess match betting groups where

573
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,140
they had like minded people. And
a couple of them were getting

574
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:28,730
into crypto. So I can't remember
there was some, some, I think,

575
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,380
weekly report that a couple of
friends had bought into that we

576
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,560
all spoke about every week that
sort of just kept our eye and

577
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,790
looking for possibilities.
Because we we were mainly

578
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,790
looking at it from a bitcoin
casino point of view, because if

579
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,660
they started putting good offers
on all you have to do is make a

580
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,380
bitcoin address, you know, it
was almost unlimited free money.

581
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,480
And unfortunately, they never
really, they never really

582
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,740
brought in big office.

583
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,010
Konrad: And you said that right
now someone can put eth to make

584
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,330
more eth. So how do you exactly
multiply is that you have? And

585
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,760
how much do you need to start
with? Because I think that's

586
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,930
also important question.

587
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,230
Carlini8: Well, it's really
easy, all you do is you mint one

588
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,830
bored ape for naught point
naught eight, if, then you just

589
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:24,830
hold it, you get you get a dog a
mutant, you know, that's fair to

590
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:30,860
say, if you go ape, it's, you
know, it's, it's the NFT Casino.

591
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,910
That's what people are doing.
And some people are very good at

592
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,720
it. And they're making a lot of
ETH. And some people are just

593
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,460
funding those people. But we do
have lots of injection of

594
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,560
Ethereum from people who truly
believe in what they're buying.

595
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,900
You have young people spending
hundreds of 1000s of ETH on

596
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,820
pieces that they truly believe
will be worth lots in 10 years

597
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,590
in 20 years. You know, when when
Gary Vee bought loads of punks

598
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,390
for a lot of ETH he's not
looking to flip, he hasn't sold

599
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,880
one, his his punks are sitting
there waiting for you know when

600
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,200
he's 80 and he can do something
with them. Whereas that Ethereum

601
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,190
he put in has gone to someone
else to then go back into the

602
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,240
casino. So these these people
are bringing in lots of Ethereum

603
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:36,050
that the true believers, I guess
that is just pumping up other

604
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,560
people's bags and letting people
then spend that Ethereum and

605
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,950
other projects and and pushing
it all up.

606
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,080
Konrad: Alright, and how do you
choose the project that you want

607
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,870
to flip? I mean, obviously, like
it can vary a lot of things like

608
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,410
hype and Tim, etc. But if
someone's looking to Soulages

609
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,350
make a lot of money quickly.
What is your criteria?

610
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,060
Carlini8: Well, right now,
you've I guess you've got a

611
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:12,220
feel, feel the hype that certain
projects have for the shore

612
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,610
things. For example, I can't
remember what is called Moon

613
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:28,510
Moon owls. The Kevin Rose one I
think is minting a 2.5 Ethereum.

614
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,470
And that certainly, that
certainly doesn't seem like it

615
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,950
will be a bad buy. But getting
onto that whitelist is hard

616
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,610
because everyone thinks it's
free Ethereum that sort of

617
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:45,040
thing. Has a solid team behind
it that have delivered multiple

618
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,250
things in their life. And I'm
sure that project will do well.

619
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,330
Whereas on the flip side, you
have a similar hype level for

620
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:57,520
things like pick someone. And
that was purely marketing. There

621
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,530
was there was no team behind it.
There was That was just a

622
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:07,510
roulette spin. But people
effectively got wrong. But some

623
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:12,400
people actually did flip and
revealed before it was seen what

624
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,770
the art looked like. But if more
if you're telling people like

625
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:24,520
how to make money, it needs to
be the solid projects. And if

626
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,710
you just, if you just know you
want to degen, I guess if you

627
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,090
know that, there's that
possibility to lose, then what

628
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:40,090
you have to do is, secure your
profits when you can. And the

629
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:46,810
hard bit is looking back, I have
owned many apes that I've sold.

630
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:53,650
And I sold them at five ETH, 10
ETH 15 ETH. And I, if you look

631
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,060
back at those, you know, it
haunts you, I owned over 100

632
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:03,820
punks. And I sold them all, you
know before, before they breach

633
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:09,820
10. And then obviously, they
went over 100. There is no one

634
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:15,550
that has perfectly traded any
NFT. So you just have to accept

635
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:22,060
that you won't be perfect. And
you're you will if you just if

636
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,560
you go pure degen, and you're
gonna hold bags. But also you

637
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,410
will get out of winners too
early. There's there's just no

638
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,560
two ways about it. I think
mindset is a big thing here.

639
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,950
Konrad: All right. Why did you
say earlier that a mint price of

640
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,670
2.5 is doesn't sound like a bad
buy.

641
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,060
Carlini8: Because of the project
itself, let me try and I can't

642
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:56,140
fully it's moon birds XYZ. So is
by is by Kevin Rose. And the

643
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:05,080
they founded proof. XYZ, which I
last time I checked that the

644
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:11,020
floor for that was 80 Ethereum.
So there's there's a lot of hype

645
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,950
going into it because of what
they've already done. Kevin Rose

646
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,520
has done a hell of a lot in his
life. And his is co founder I

647
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,640
can't remember what his name is.
Ken just trying to have a quick

648
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,940
scroll to for remember, I've
listened to their spaces, but I

649
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,890
can't remember his name. They've
both done a lot of big deals and

650
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,090
like they could be retired if
they wanted to be there. I think

651
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,030
it's a good if you have the
opportunity, I think that should

652
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:44,530
be bought because it very much
feels like with the experience

653
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,940
the team have the hype around
the project and their ability

654
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,470
2.5 ETH won't be where it stops
just comparing it to the other

655
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,150
projects on the market at the
moment.

656
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,680
Konrad: Yep. All right. If
you're if you're comparing the

657
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,130
NFT let's say the NFT casino to
what you did back back almost 10

658
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:14,340
years ago, right? The gambling
business. It was matched betting

659
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:19,110
right. Match betting means
you're betting on a match. It's

660
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,450
a football match, or how do I
understand?

661
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,150
Carlini8: Well, just like in, in
the simplest terms, a match bet

662
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,260
would be betting on every
outcome. So it doesn't have to

663
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,500
be football. But if you're
betting on football, you could

664
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:41,370
bet on win draw and loss. But
you you bet on a win with

665
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,530
whatever company you've just
signed up to, which then will

666
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,980
allow you to get a free bet from
them. So they'll give you a fake

667
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:57,330
100 pounds, which you can then
use later on a second bet. And

668
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:02,190
then you lay the bet somewhere
like Betfair where and a lay

669
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:06,570
just means not so you would bet
on not win with Betfair and you

670
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,410
bet on a win with whatever
company it is, but you can also

671
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,860
you can bet on tennis is quite a
common one. You know, there are

672
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,390
only two outcomes there. Even
even horse racing, you know

673
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,270
people people did it on the
Grand National just the other

674
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:25,740
day because you could if you
cover every horse are using

675
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,300
these this free money that they
give you, you then have quite

676
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,630
the result at the end although
after about a year or so I moved

677
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:41,130
away from match betting and it
was actually the casino side of

678
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:46,470
things. But it was in a match
betting way. I guess running it.

679
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,200
The maths was on my side, but
you could go on bad losing runs.

680
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,990
Konrad: All right. And you
started math right. So I guess

681
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:01,560
that helped you with the
probability calculations right?

682
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,480
Carlini8: A bit, but the word
calculators so it's not like I

683
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,830
was doing stuff on the fly in my
head. I was more just keying

684
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,890
stuff into spreadsheets, but
just understanding how it

685
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:17,460
worked. Quite a lot of people
who made a lot of money doing

686
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,280
this. Had no idea about the
mouse. And they quite often

687
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,520
would get scared after a few
months of losing.

688
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,930
Konrad: Alright, interesting.
But it's still fair to say that

689
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,590
you were some kind of genius,
right? I mean, I mean, you still

690
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,350
are right, but not now. You're a
NFT. Genius.

691
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,600
Carlini8: You can't You're not
allowed to say that yourself.

692
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,670
Well, no, it's not. I'm not
even. I'm not book smarts. I'm

693
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,390
just, I guess, internet smarts.
I know. I know, my way around

694
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,370
the internet. Now is what

695
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:57,389
Konrad: did you did you watch
the Netflix movie? There was

696
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:00,599
like a Netflix movie where there
was like a guy from College,

697
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:05,579
where he was in like, a US
college and went to the math

698
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:09,569
class. And he was like, super
good. And then the teacher.

699
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:15,299
Like, one, yeah. 21. And yeah,
and they they played blackjack

700
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:19,589
and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
that was super, super inspiring.

701
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:26,039
They made tons of money and
lost. And lost it. Oh, by the

702
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:30,569
way, how did your your boss
react? When you when you went to

703
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:33,689
him and told them now? Well,

704
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,100
Carlini8: I, I, I walked up to
her. And I said, Can I can I

705
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:42,030
have a word? And her reply was,
Oh, good. You don't have a

706
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:47,280
letter. Because she was she was
a client. So she knew how much I

707
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,980
was making at the time. So like,
it wasn't a secret in the office

708
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,220
or anything like that. And my
reply to her was, oh, I need a

709
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,910
letter do I? She was so went to
the meeting room. And yes, she

710
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,090
just, she knew it was coming and
said something along the lines

711
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:07,350
of, there's no amount of money I
can offer you to keep you as the

712
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,820
as I said, not within your
budget. We are still friends, I

713
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:17,190
still went early 2015. So we're
coming up to seven years. And

714
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,330
you know, I've, I've had a meal
with it this year. A couple of

715
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,070
old work friends I still meet up
with

716
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:29,550
Konrad: All right, so I mean, my
original question was, if you

717
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,690
compare the NFT, casino to the,
to the gambling business you

718
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,410
did, where do you see
connections? What did you learn?

719
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,090
What learnings have you done
previously, with your gambling

720
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,910
business? You know, maybe
controlling your emotions,

721
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,400
focusing on on demand for the
right rational thinking and

722
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,910
stuff? What learnings did you
make from your previous

723
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,270
experience that you think, or
that you can share with the

724
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:01,770
community that is interested in
let's say, the NFT. Casino?

725
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,106
Carlini8: It was it was mindset,
really. Because gambling before

726
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:09,745
was very mathematical. I knew
that if I kept going, I should

727
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:14,383
make money. It didn't mean that
I would. Because when you're

728
00:53:13,780 --> 00:54:56,530
I can see quite easily an NFT
being worth, you know, a floor

729
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:19,098
doing things like to maximize
Evie, you take the whole amount

730
00:53:19,174 --> 00:53:23,889
of money. So say I deposited 200
pounds, and I got a 200 pound

731
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:28,756
bonus, I'd put all 400 pounds on
one number on roulette, purely

732
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:33,547
because that was mathematically
the best way to do it. So when

733
00:53:33,623 --> 00:53:38,109
you're just throwing away for
throwing away money until you

734
00:53:38,185 --> 00:53:42,520
hit because there are 37 slots
on a roulette wheel. So in

735
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:47,311
theory, I should hit one in 37.
You know, that takes a toll on

736
00:53:47,387 --> 00:53:51,950
you if if you just have a bad
day, and it's very possible to

737
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:56,436
go 100 without hitting. And
you're just like, oh my god, a

738
00:53:56,512 --> 00:54:00,847
terrible day, you just always
think if I'd literally done

739
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:05,562
nothing today, if I stayed in
bed, I'd be so much richer than

740
00:54:05,638 --> 00:54:10,276
I was than I am now. So what a
waste of my time I've spent my

741
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:14,991
time and my effort and I'm down.
And I've done exactly what I

742
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:19,706
should. Now you can't do that in
the NFT world because buying

743
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:24,269
something and expecting it to go
up isn't maths, it's not a

744
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:28,983
formula. It's not set in stone,
what should happen. It's more

745
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:33,850
feeling. But what you can do is
you can be in the right mindset

746
00:54:33,926 --> 00:54:38,793
when Cryptos dumping like it is
now to just take a step back and

747
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:43,660
really look is this is crypto a
thing? Are we actually going to

748
00:54:43,736 --> 00:54:48,375
still be here in 10 years? And
yes, I very, I very much think

749
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:53,014
it's a certainty at this point.
And I think NFTs are in that

750
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:57,880
space. So if you can handle the
ups and the downs of these main

751
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:02,291
projects that have teams that
are staying, that are doing

752
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:06,930
things that are going to be
impactful in a few years. If you

753
00:55:04,990 --> 00:58:02,860
of 1000 Ethereum. Very long
term. I can't tell you what one

754
00:55:07,006 --> 00:55:11,569
have the conviction like The
people I've known who have made

755
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:16,131
the most in NFT, since 2017, are
those that have gone for a

756
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:20,770
project and made insane bets on
them. So I know Pranksy very

757
00:55:20,846 --> 00:55:25,333
well I got Pranksy into the
space. I, I, you know, was in a

758
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:30,200
slack with Pranksy, pre crypto
kitties in 2017. And pranksy, he

759
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:35,142
had 1250 bored ape or one point
and sold most of them on the way

760
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:39,629
up made, Mises made millions of
pounds and is credited for

761
00:55:39,705 --> 00:55:43,964
effectively, very carefully
selling them and helping not

762
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,450
crushed the community. Because
if it Pranksy just be like,

763
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:53,241
right, let's list them all. One
if you know, that wall just is

764
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:58,108
never getting crossed. I don't
think bored apes make it because

765
00:55:58,184 --> 00:56:02,823
the community wouldn't be as
feel good as it was. Because the

766
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:07,690
community is strong. But it was
weaker back then obviously, and

767
00:56:07,766 --> 00:56:12,404
the growth helped strengthen
them. And on the flip side, I've

768
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,271
also friends with Jimmy Dot eth,
who held a couple of hundreds,

769
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:22,062
at the same time and sold less
and still has maybe 80. And his

770
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:26,929
conviction just led to you know,
we're talking it's a bit crazy

771
00:56:27,005 --> 00:56:31,188
here because we're talking
retired for the rest of your

772
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:35,978
life with an insane budget. And
the difference between retired

773
00:56:36,054 --> 00:56:40,769
for the rest of your life and
then same budget and a couple of

774
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:45,560
yachts. So you know, it's it's a
ridiculous gap. But it's also

775
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:50,123
the minimum we're talking about
is already huge. So the big

776
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:54,533
winners, when you look back are
always those who buy into

777
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:59,172
projects that they believe in
and stick with them. You know,

778
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:04,191
cocoa bear is someone else. Snow
fro I tried to get him to sell a

779
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:08,602
zombie crypto punks, zombie for
fingers 40 Ethereum, when

780
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:13,392
Ethereum was maybe $800, it was
something like that. And I was

781
00:57:13,468 --> 00:57:17,879
like, Look, you need to sell
you've got 30 of them. And he

782
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:22,670
was going to spend it on real
estate which eventually ended up

783
00:57:22,746 --> 00:57:27,157
being a staging place for our
block. So I think he's still

784
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:32,023
happy with the sale because of
where it led. But he had so many

785
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:36,434
posts. So many zombie punks. And
it was so hard for me to

786
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:41,453
convince him to sell one further
time the highest sale ever, that

787
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:45,940
these people just have the
conviction and they stick to it

788
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:50,654
and they make lots of money. I
can't tell anyone if that sort

789
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,480
of time period is over.

790
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,370
that's going to be obviously
apes are currently leading the

791
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:11,950
charge and they're your safest
bet. But is that how you make

792
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:16,270
lots of money now? I'm I'm not
sure. All right.

793
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:21,730
Valerio: All right. By the way,
talking about apes, I heard that

794
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:29,770
that you thought that the launch
of the ape token that you didn't

795
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,770
think you made a good job on
that. Am I right?

796
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,970
Carlini8: I don't like that the
apes don't yield the token. Yes,

797
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:45,760
I think we're releasing our own
token for Purrnelope's Country

798
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:54,010
Club. And I think about token
hours a day. And I have maybe

799
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,320
four months at this point, maybe
even five or six. And I much

800
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,480
prefer an NFT. That yields a
token. Because you're adding

801
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,370
value to the NFT. At this point,
apes have two things. They have

802
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:15,700
the ape token, and they have the
NFT. And in my mind, the token

803
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:20,650
is taking away value from the NF
T but the question here is, can

804
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:24,310
they use the funds they raised
from the token to offset that

805
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,360
loss for apes. And for them?
They probably can be they can

806
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:33,850
use the funds to build enough
for apes. But I don't think

807
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:39,850
anyone else can. So if anyone
copies them. That's a problem.

808
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,590
And historically, everyone
copies apes like there's just no

809
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:48,670
two ways about it. Someone will
try and copy them and they won't

810
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:52,060
launch on every exchange at the
same time the first token ever

811
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,740
to do that. They won't have
these these backings providing

812
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,070
the liquidity early on or have
the funds to do that and They

813
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,710
will just take their whole
projects with a token that

814
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,910
ultimately people don't want.
For instance, board apes had

815
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:11,530
some launched ape with utility,
that just doesn't work for any

816
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:15,430
other projects that you need
utility out the gate, or it's

817
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:19,930
not going to work. Or it's an
uphill battle, I guess at that

818
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,890
point, it's much easier to
launch with utility than to

819
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,290
launch without it and then try
and capture it

820
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,640
Konrad: just allows you launch
your own token right now won't

821
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,870
be like the exact steps you will
take and what will be the

822
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,460
utility for the token itself.

823
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,130
Carlini8: Wonderful. First step
is to do it legally. So I can't

824
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:47,430
launch it in the UK. So the
token is going to be launched in

825
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:50,850
the British Virgin Isles, there
is a company already set up.

826
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:59,970
Just paid for within arm's
reach. When did this the 15th of

827
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:05,280
December, it was launched that
just shows how far back we were

828
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,520
thinking about it. So we can
legally launch the token, most

829
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,210
tokens aren't launched legally.
And I think that will be a big

830
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:17,160
problem for projects as well,
because like I've said earlier,

831
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,660
the team is the important bit
when teams are covered. If

832
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,320
you're successful, you bring
more light onto your projects.

833
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,650
And when it's eventually found
out that a token wasn't launched

834
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:33,030
legally and the team is pursued,
you know, they might abandon the

835
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,940
project, or they might go to
prison, they're not going to

836
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:41,970
keep working on on this
illegally launch token now. So

837
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:46,200
step one is to launch it
legally, which is all sorts of

838
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,090
and step two is to provide the
utility. So what what I've done

839
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:54,960
is I've looked at a lot of other
projects that have done similar

840
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,270
things. So Cyberkongz, for
example, have a yielding token,

841
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:06,270
and it was very successful with
them, breeding babies sup ducks

842
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:10,140
had volt. And that went well
with the snack shop that they

843
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:14,430
had. So we'll be launching our
tier twos, which is effectively

844
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,830
our, our mutants or our meebit,
you know, that sort of level of

845
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:25,290
the community. And that will be
purely, it will be purely in

846
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,700
token. So you can only receive
that with token. So people will

847
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:35,040
be using it to gain that long
term will want it in our NFT

848
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,790
world.

849
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:41,190
Konrad: James James, can you
quickly clarify what you mean

850
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,520
exactly by a yield token?

851
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:50,910
Carlini8: So just normally,
every day, you get a little

852
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:56,550
trickle of the token. So it
builds up over time,

853
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,720
effectively.

854
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,750
Valerio: So instead of instead
of getting hammered, how much do

855
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,280
they get, like 20 20,000 Apes
per per bored ape, right? So

856
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,770
instead of getting all 20,000,
you should get them like on a on

857
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:14,400
a schedule, right? Like, daily
or something?

858
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:19,010
Carlini8: Yes, it's slowly
slowly release it. Because if

859
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,920
you have all of the tokens,
you're going to get up front,

860
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,100
they did, you know, they sent a
lot to the DAO and the DAO is

861
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:30,590
voting on some sort of token
yielding. But they're, they're

862
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:35,360
doing it where you lock up, ape
to get it and the NFT counts as

863
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:41,150
a key. It's it's a little tricky
to talk about now because

864
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,870
something was proposed. And then
the apes voted it down. And now

865
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,600
something new is being proposed.
And we're not sure if it's

866
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,460
actually going to happen yet. So
we don't actually know how

867
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,600
they're doing it. But they're
like their AirDrop, for example.

868
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,730
Wasn't that much. wasn't a big
percentage. I don't have the

869
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:04,700
figures in front of me right
now. But it was it was maybe 20%

870
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:09,680
was the airdrop 40% was the DAO
and then the rest went to Yuga,

871
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,260
the charity partners and the
team I think

872
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,280
Konrad: one more thing I would
like to touch on aside from

873
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,780
token is a team which mentioned
a lot during this episode. So

874
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:32,010
how to build a really good team
that will stay with you for a

875
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,420
long time. And I second question
will be how much money do you

876
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,500
need upfront? Because no one
really talks about salaries for

877
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,130
teams. So like, if you'd like to
start your own project, how much

878
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,680
would you need to pay them on a
monthly basis?

879
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:53,350
Carlini8: Well, that's that's
tricky because when you start

880
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:58,990
bringing in this in this sort of
space, people can be from

881
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,230
anywhere, right? You don't, you
don't have to hire around you,

882
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:06,460
you don't have to hire in the
US. You know, even like, none of

883
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:10,000
the Purrnelope's team, there
isn't an office, we don't meet

884
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,110
up everyone's remote. So the
team could in theory be from

885
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,160
anywhere. And what you need to
do is you need to make sure you

886
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,900
get the right people in the
right places, but that doesn't.

887
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,780
That's more about their skills.
So you need your community

888
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:32,530
manager to have web 3
experience, for example, you

889
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:36,850
need your community manager to
know about NF Ts, because that's

890
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,450
who they interact with, you
can't have them looking like a

891
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:44,140
complete noob in front of your
community. Whereas say, your

892
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,830
website dev doesn't need to,
they can just be a really good

893
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,880
website dev from web two. So
there are certain roles where

894
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,270
you can pull in web two, and
there are certain roles where

895
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:59,500
you really need web three. And
there are some that you can kind

896
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,300
of cross over, for example,
marketing, you, you probably

897
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,780
need at least one person in your
marketing team who knows about

898
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:12,310
web three and is experienced in
it. But a really good marketer

899
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,780
from web 2 world or just you
know, anywhere can then come in

900
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:23,770
and bring ideas to help grow
your project that way. Salary

901
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:32,290
wise, it's you, you want to pay
people well, you'll be looking

902
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:38,710
at high end pay. certain roles
are very tricky to get. Now you

903
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:46,240
can even a solidity Dev, what
you can do is find a dev in web

904
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:53,650
two, to learn solidity because
depending on your projects, they

905
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,580
there's there's a lot they can
look at. So if you're just doing

906
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:02,950
a 10k PFP, for example, they can
look at our project or apes or

907
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:05,500
doodles and look at their
contract because it's all open

908
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,250
source, and see how to do it
themselves. And then after

909
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,850
enough time, they become you
know, if you've got someone who

910
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:16,240
really wants to better
themselves, they can then learn

911
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:21,340
enough over that time. Because
in reality, there aren't really,

912
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,640
you know, the best Ethereum devs
haven't been doing it 10 years

913
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,540
because Ethereum isn't 10 years
old. It's more about how quickly

914
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,910
people learn and how willing
they are to learn.

915
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,870
Valerio: And it's cheaper like
that, right? It's cheaper,

916
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:40,240
getting a web 2 dev, learn
solidity instead of hiring a web

917
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,780
three dev,

918
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,040
Carlini8: it's also easier,
yeah, because there are more of

919
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,590
them than there are that already
know solidity. And the issue

920
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:55,270
with solidity. devs is they know
how much is going to how much

921
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:59,110
your NFTs are going to sell for.
And that then makes it quite

922
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:04,990
tricky. Especially if you're
mainly putting back into the

923
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:11,740
community. So like, I think we
sold out for $3 million, I think

924
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,310
it was when you at the time and
you know, multiply it all out

925
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:22,720
the 800. If we took in that, you
know, maybe 10% of that has gone

926
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,590
on salary, it's without No,
probably it will be more than

927
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:29,650
10% Just you know, thinking
about it quickly for a second.

928
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:35,440
But it's not a huge chunk. Most
of it has gone back in and none

929
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:40,390
of it has gone into anyone's
pocket. So you need a team that

930
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:47,500
will understand it is a company.
And most you know web two people

931
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,860
coming into web three would see
it as that. Whereas if someone's

932
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,530
been in NFTs quite a long time,
they might have seen you know

933
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:56,290
pudgy penguins, they minted out
and sent all the Ethereum to

934
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:02,590
their own private wallets. Which
was a bit crazy at the time. And

935
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,700
for me, that's that's a bit of a
red flag and they went on to

936
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:13,660
then sell the project someone
else a few days ago. So fine,

937
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:19,420
finding a team is hard. you're
best off building friends first

938
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:25,210
building a friendship group
thinking who's in, you know who

939
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,880
actually wants to be in this
what their skills, place them in

940
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,320
the right place, and then go and
find what you don't have the

941
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:35,740
will you'll never be able to get
a group of friends that have

942
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:40,540
everything. Bored apes, for
example, went and found the

943
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:45,250
artists they didn't even have
the ability to create this art

944
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:50,920
that has become so monumental.
They hired in three or four

945
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,940
artists for that. So you just
got to play to your strengths

946
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,520
and find what you can in reality
to find you can either change

947
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,520
your name on Twitter to is
hiring, I see that a lot. So I

948
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:09,520
assume it works. That's not what
I did. Or discord, we found

949
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,740
website 2.0 People just because
in one of the channels, one of

950
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:19,990
the discourse has a NFT Bill
doors channel, and they just

951
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:25,150
posted, hey, we were web devs
just looking to do some things.

952
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,900
And I contacted them. And that's
sort of how that connection was

953
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:32,710
made. So it's just been active,
sort of living and breathing.

954
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,470
The project, I guess, alright,

955
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:39,020
Valerio: can you still do that
now? Or, or what what would now

956
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:43,760
be the best and most efficient
way to find dev to find artists

957
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,130
to find different people for
your team?

958
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,400
Carlini8: If you're looking to
launch soon, and you've already

959
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,260
got, you know, a couple of
crypto NFT friends, for artists,

960
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:00,640
honestly, I'd go to Instagram,
you know, it's I'd scroll

961
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,830
Instagram, I'd put in some kind
of art hashtag. I'd scroll until

962
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:10,600
I find some art that looks
great. And I'd I'd message maybe

963
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:15,160
20 People have great looking at
have some sort of pitch message

964
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:20,410
that's like, Hey, we're looking
to build this. We were looking

965
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:24,250
for an artist we'd like to what
I'd say to them is that we're

966
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:27,070
looking to have someone
involved, we want an artist who

967
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:32,140
will continue to work on this,
you'll probably be skeptical of

968
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,250
NFTs because everyone outside of
NFTs hates NFTs is pretty much

969
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,540
how it goes. So I would, I would
say look, I'm willing to listen

970
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:44,710
to all your concerns, artists
will probably have the two main

971
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:50,560
concerns of selling stolen art,
which is better than the real

972
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,260
world, which is very annoying,
because you only know the art is

973
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:58,120
getting sold because of the NFT.
And it's not most NFTs and it's

974
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,650
no successful NFTs. And the
environment, which you can then

975
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:06,970
talk about the merge is coming
and that will make Ethereum so

976
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:09,580
much better better than paying
on a canvas and shipping it

977
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,920
across the world. And then get
them involved. Have them as a co

978
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,430
founder Don't say, I mean, if
you want to make as much money

979
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,040
as possible, what you do is you
you basically screw over the

980
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,670
artist and you say yeah, we'll
do it for we'll do a fixed fee,

981
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:30,460
and you do that. But my artist
is Apollo have more now. But at

982
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:35,620
the time I said look full time
job salary. Come on in both,

983
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:40,690
there was no sort of percentages
because we're not splitting it.

984
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:44,440
We weren't minting and then
splitting the cash. But if you

985
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:49,990
just say, look, you're a co
founder you're in. Eventually

986
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:53,830
you'd find it artists that way
is I think, all right,

987
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:58,890
Konrad: cool. How did you pay
your artists a salary if you

988
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,910
didn't launch your project that
just with your own money? Or

989
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:07,550
Carlini8: yeah, so I, I said to
these two guys, that I'd fund it

990
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:11,540
for a year already. Because, you
know, as in NFTs and NFTs have

991
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,960
gone crazy. And it's so quite a
few and I had money set aside.

992
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:18,890
So I put some money aside, and
in my head that was for this

993
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:23,150
project. And when that run run
out, you know, it was over, I

994
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:29,060
guess. So this was this was a
bet on the project working? And

995
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:32,750
if the money if the money ran
out that was that, I guess.

996
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,970
Konrad: All right. Well, if you
take someone on the percentage,

997
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:39,600
then you may you're like sure
that they will be very involved

998
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,930
in that they believe in the
project itself. And I'm

999
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:43,830
committed.

1000
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:48,120
Carlini8: Yeah, and artists who
will be working on it more than

1001
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:51,690
right, can you make this 10k
PFP. For me, and then when it's

1002
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:55,590
done, that's done. But if the
artist is in, they could make

1003
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,620
the 10k PFP. And then they could
start work on some marketing

1004
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:01,320
materials, go on Twitter, and
then they can start working on

1005
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,520
your secondary products or just,
you know, fun stuff where your

1006
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:12,120
your profile picture project is
in a scene and build up the law

1007
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,670
because they truly believe in
the project because that in the

1008
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,010
projects is it's just a lot
better that way.

1009
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:23,130
Konrad: All right. So I'm trying
to recap for our listeners. So

1010
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:27,000
to find an artist, you suggest
going to Instagram and then

1011
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,020
search for a specific hashtag.
Do you maybe have a short

1012
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,070
example of a hash tag?

1013
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:37,350
Carlini8: Well, it depends what
you're you're going for. I was

1014
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:44,250
looking for a H fans and artists
this way not not for our project

1015
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:49,500
but for something specific
within the project. And I think

1016
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,410
it was building art because I
was looking for sort of

1017
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:57,570
landscape and that sort of
thread. So every you know, like

1018
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:02,340
if you're if you're doing a seal
project You know, try just

1019
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:06,330
hashtag art and look at the
reasons, but maybe CLR, PT or

1020
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:09,990
animal art, or I don't know if
those hashtags are real, you

1021
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:12,600
know, just just get a bit
creative around what you're

1022
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,320
looking at, for the artists to
do. All right, and you should be

1023
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,040
able to find it.

1024
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:20,390
Konrad: Like just a quick tip,
if you if you want one profile,

1025
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:24,350
you can just press the arrow
button next to the Follow

1026
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:27,860
button, and it will have a drop
down of similar profiles. So

1027
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:33,350
like, you will have suggested
similar ones. Smart move, Konrad

1028
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,950
Carlini8: did not know that. I
live in Instagram noob.

1029
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:40,160
Valerio: All right, and then
have you your pitch message

1030
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,510
ready and send them a nice pitch
and stuff. What about devs

1031
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:50,330
though? I mean, I assume web
three depths or like the, like

1032
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:53,000
the web three job with the
highest demand, but the low

1033
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,110
supply? Am I right?

1034
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:58,620
Carlini8: It's very much seems
that way. I've seen a couple

1035
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:03,930
people claiming on Twitter that
it's good community managers are

1036
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:08,730
really? And I guess that's,
that's hard to quantify, because

1037
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,170
they're very much saying good.
So, you know, what does? What

1038
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:17,700
does that mean? You know, people
will have fun. Yeah, exactly.

1039
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:24,320
Valerio: So if you had to go and
find, like, one, a web three dev

1040
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,740
right now and a community
manager now, what would you do

1041
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,450
it? And? And yeah,

1042
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:33,860
Carlini8: I think I would try
and pull a community manager

1043
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:39,080
from a community I was already
in. So an active discord that

1044
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:44,510
I'm in, I would try looking for.
I think I just already know, by

1045
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:49,040
being in the, in the discords. A
couple of people who I think

1046
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,990
have the potential to do the job
well. And I'd I'd I'd kind of

1047
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:58,790
rank them and speak to them in
that order, I guess. Dev YT Dev.

1048
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:07,430
I, I just I just knew one.
That's it. That's my problem. I

1049
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:13,670
I knew a dev who I think I was
in a discord with them. And I

1050
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,240
was saying like, I'm trying to
find a web 3 Dev, it's really

1051
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,630
hard, not sort of fishing, but
just sort of in general. And

1052
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,570
they were like, I could try it.
I was like, Okay, you think so?

1053
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:28,610
So yeah, it would be hard. I'll
just read some contracts and go

1054
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,460
from there. And they basically
just read loads of contracts and

1055
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,920
got used to the language and
figured it all out.

1056
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:39,840
Konrad: We have two tabs. But I
guess like, GitHub is big for

1057
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,550
for devs. write or read it and
because I heard some people just

1058
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:50,160
you know, post on Reddit or go
to communities on Reddit. And

1059
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:55,590
that's but yeah. And if you
know, a specific thing you would

1060
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:58,410
do right now to get the depth.
You can tell it if not.

1061
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:03,760
Carlini8: I'd asked my dad if he
knew any devs, because he's a

1062
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:09,820
dev. B, and here's the issue is
he's not really motivated by

1063
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:14,080
money. He's motivated by
enjoying his job. So maybe I

1064
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,010
could convince him to do it.
Such that he just doesn't care

1065
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:21,820
about NFTs enough. But I could
ask him to find me a dev from

1066
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,870
work or something like that, or
from a past job. Who's a good

1067
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:29,410
Dev, you know? And so obviously,
that doesn't, if your listeners

1068
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,630
want to call my dad his numbers,
oh seven.

1069
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:38,170
Konrad: Because when you said
that you need a web 2 dev and to

1070
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:41,830
learn like to make him learn
solidity. It sounds like super

1071
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,890
hard task. Because what do you
say like you approach him and

1072
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:47,230
say, Hey, I'm gonna build this
project, I need you for it.

1073
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,840
Like, all you have to do is
learn solidity and that's it.

1074
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,150
It's possible.

1075
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,120
Carlini8: To us it sounds really
hard. But from from the devs

1076
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,930
have spoken to that have learned
it, they've said it's not too

1077
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:06,420
tricky. Like if, if they're
generally a good Dev, I think

1078
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,980
they should be able to make the
basic leap that you need to

1079
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:16,320
launch a project, they should be
able to do that quite easily. If

1080
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:16,590
you're there

1081
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,500
Konrad: well, it's it's smiley,
or is it dimension division,

1082
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,350
Carlini8: everyone will be
different, but over the same way

1083
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:29,910
as the artists that try and get
them properly in, you know, to

1084
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:35,700
to join your vision. You're
going to need a reason for this

1085
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:41,940
project. Like what are you doing
differently that is going to you

1086
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,460
know, why? Why why are people
going to care about your

1087
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,880
project, you need to convince
them that you can actually mint

1088
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,760
out and get the funds to make
this into a proper job.

1089
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:57,320
Valerio: All right, cool. I see.
Thank you. Carlini. I think that

1090
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:02,510
was some some fire advice for
are all our listeners very, very

1091
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:08,090
valuable? The last thing before
we let you go? It's something I

1092
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:14,930
always love to talk about. What
Why do you like? I mean, you

1093
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:18,380
talked about Bitcoin first,
right? And how you like it? How

1094
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,920
we prefer a few than Bitcoin
because you can build

1095
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:27,680
applications or you can build
stuff on Ethereum. But how

1096
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:30,260
what's what's your point of view
on the topic of

1097
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:35,960
decentralization? Because that's
something that I am concerned.

1098
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,440
And that's also what I focus a
lot. And decentralization is

1099
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,460
important for me, right? And
bitcoin is just way more

1100
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,450
decentralized than Ethereum, for
example, so that's why I'm a

1101
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:52,190
little bit I mean, of course,
Ethereum 2.0 is coming out and

1102
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:57,170
the merge will be great. And,
and but how do you see the point

1103
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:01,610
of decentralization that if
you're young guys, the boys from

1104
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:05,540
the foundation are holding
almost 70% of the tokens and

1105
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:10,430
stuff? And, I mean, we just went
from proof of work to proof of

1106
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:13,520
stake right? Like that,

1107
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,300
Carlini8: to me, it's a level of
scale. Like decentralization

1108
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:25,210
isn't yes or no. Like. Bitcoin
is more decentralized, but it

1109
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:29,710
isn't completely decentralized
because someone can set up it's

1110
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:35,170
just a matter of tech right? If
you have enough mining power, it

1111
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:39,070
Bitcoin isn't decentralized,
because you have enough to 51%

1112
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:44,890
attack or whatever. It's just a
different level to Ethereum it

1113
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:49,780
is more decentralized. But for
me, I'm not personally too

1114
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:55,270
worried because it is Ethereum
is far more decentralized than

1115
01:21:55,630 --> 01:22:00,610
Solana what we already have,
yeah. Well, Solana is just a

1116
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:04,090
Google spreadsheet in my mind.
So it's, it's about as

1117
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:08,770
decentralized as the, you know,
my my organizational

1118
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:13,570
spreadsheets? Unless Sam you're
listening and you want to invest

1119
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:17,200
in PCC, then it's the most
decentralized token in the world

1120
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:24,340
is the best and I love it. If
you're not it's No, I, you know,

1121
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:28,810
I'm very surface level on Solana
and the surface level seems to

1122
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:32,830
be it turns off all the time,
and it runs on about four PCs.

1123
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:39,550
But for me, Ethereum is
decentralized enough. And I

1124
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:45,040
guess what I care about more is
the stuff on it. So you can read

1125
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,520
everything is open source? Well,
most things that people interact

1126
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,940
with are open source, and they
can be checked. And you have

1127
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:56,170
people like quit going through
contracts, when they're launched

1128
01:22:56,170 --> 01:23:01,150
and telling everyone what's in
them. And it's, it's that level

1129
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:05,530
of openness, that is more
important to me, because that

1130
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:12,580
will matter. To the users like
what we're doing is changing

1131
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:19,060
everyday life in a more simple
way. Whereas Bitcoin, I guess,

1132
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:23,470
you could argue, will have a
huge effect, because it depends

1133
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:27,730
how, you know, doom and gloom,
er, and the whole economy of the

1134
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:33,610
world. But if you're not on that
side of the scale, if if that

1135
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:37,270
isn't a huge worry for you,
which you know, people like you,

1136
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:43,390
it should be your main worry.
For me, you know, personally, I

1137
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:46,960
don't think it will get there,
I'm sure you know, will be sent

1138
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,840
laser links and do your own
research and all this stuff

1139
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:53,560
about how I should have hundreds
of Bitcoin because the world's

1140
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:59,110
going going to hell. But I guess
living in my nicer, happier

1141
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:06,520
bubble, of where, where we don't
think governments are trying to

1142
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:11,650
kill us off in a great reset.
The fact is, we can't scam each

1143
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:19,120
other as easily on Ethereum in
more everyday life. So Ethereum

1144
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,260
is more decentralized than what
we have now. So it is better.

1145
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:27,730
And I It doesn't matter to me
that there's something even more

1146
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,590
decentralized because you can't
do stuff with it, I guess.

1147
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:38,290
Valerio: All right. All right. I
mean, I think it's big on film.

1148
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:41,800
They have two different use
cases. I mean, exactly. Yeah.

1149
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,540
Carlini8: They don't they're not
competing in any way.

1150
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:47,020
Valerio: Exactly. We cannot put
them we cannot compare them and

1151
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,330
try to make them compete each
other. I mean,

1152
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,820
Carlini8: coingecko and that's
about it.

1153
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:57,790
Valerio: Exactly. All right.
Yeah. Cool. Thank you so much,

1154
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,980
Konrad. Do you have any
questions?

1155
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,730
Konrad: Still, now I've asked
all the ones to ask. So yeah,

1156
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,490
thank you very much Carlini for
joining us today. It was a

1157
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:07,480
pleasure talking to

1158
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,400
Carlini8: No problem. Thanks for
having me on.

1159
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:13,710
Konrad: It was an amazing
podcast man. It was super super

1160
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,600
insightful and valuable and I'm
sure the community can can learn

1161
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,430
a lot from from what you share.
