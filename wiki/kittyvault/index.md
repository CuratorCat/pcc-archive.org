## What is Kitty Vault?

The Kitty Vault is a vault of NFTs that backs every PCC Cats, Kittens, companion2 and main airdrops. The idea is that the Vault will operate as a 'Gold Standard' so your PCC collections will always have some inherent worth.

The whole collection will be fractionalized with [fractional.art](https://fractional.art) 2.0 [^1]. The Team will do this once the team can ensure the fractional.art vault can still recieve tokens, airdrops, etc. There are many projects in there that have upcoming companions, airdrops, tokens etc and we want those benefits to come to the Vault for everyone's benefit.

Each Cat, and each main airdrop (8 in total) will be able to be redeemed for one KittyVault Token (not the $Token, will be using KVCoin here). That KVCoin will be tradable for 1/100,000 of the Vault's value.

## Who lives in the Kitty Vault?

CryptoPunks, CyberKongs, Bored Apes, Cool Cats, Stoner Cats, Purrs and more.
