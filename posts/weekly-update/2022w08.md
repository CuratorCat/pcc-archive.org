## Purrnelope’s Country Club Weekly Update: week of February 21st 2022

What a week at the Country Club. To be honest it’s more accurate to say what a few months but we have finally let the cat out of the bag on [Roadmap 2.0](../post/2022-02-25-roadmap-2-0-6-months-on-from-launch.md)! If for some reason you haven’t read the roadmap stop reading this and go now.

Seriously.

Okay, welcome back.

A couple highlights to reiterate:

- We will build an entire country club in NFT Worlds thanks to our partnership with [Entity Builds](https://entitybuilds.com/).
- The country club will have at **least** 4 games for you to play.
- We will have packs of equipable items, skins, cosmetics and improvements you can buy with $TOKEN.
- We will have merch that is closely integrated with web 3… what does that mean exactly? Patience. We will share when it is time :)
- AND we are actively building our lore around Purrnelope’s Country Club. We have [hinted at this previously](https://opensea.io/assets/0xda7d42b6167f1497346d7b2336a6d7a603026db1/3) but you will see a renewed focus on lore building.

Some stats about you, our community. 95% of our holders have been with us for over a month and 86.6% have been with us for over 3 months. You know how quickly NFTs move. This is an incredible stat and gives us great pride in working for you all day in and day out.

> “I want to thank our community, I want to thank everyone who minted, everyone who has bought a Purr since. You are all part of our journey and it really helps us get up and build everyday.” — [Carlini](https://twitter.com/Carlini8N)

That’s all for now,
