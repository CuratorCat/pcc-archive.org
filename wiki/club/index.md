Purrnelope's Country Club ([www.purrnelopescountryclub.com](https://purrnelopescountryclub.com/)) was founded by Carlini8, launched in July 2021 with a quick and simple comment:

> _“Purrnelope's Country Club is something else entirely. We’re the type of loyal cats that are here to stay.”_ [^1]

## .pcc.eth ENS

[.pcc.eth ENS subdomains](../ens/index.md) are viral on twitter. It is free for PCC Cat holders to claim. More readable for wallet address, use the cat as PFP on web3, and the brand of PCC Community.

<img src={imgToken} className="wikiPostListImgR" />

## Token

**$TOKEN** has not been released yet. NFTs from main [collections](../collections/index.md) will be able to yield $TOKEN. $TOKENs will be used for purchasing packs, community governance etc.

## Merch

The merchandise was planned since Roadmap V1, and the team is currently working hard on the merch. Some merch will require redeem using [Purrks](../collections/kittyvault-purrks/index.md) NFTs to redeem, e.g. Hoodies, 3D Model, Comic Book, Music Record, Keyboard and Ledger Nano S.

## Games

Games are planned in [Roadmap V2](/posts/2022/02/25/post/roadmap-2-0-6-months-on-from-launch). Currently the Team is working with Entity Builds developing the first game in the NFT Worlds metaverse. Entity Builds is a best-in-class studio with incredible Minecraft builders, devs and designers.
