### Sticker Note

There is a sticker note on the keyboard with `C4rb0n4lyfe` written on it. Translates as `Carbon for Life`, seems some geek put it there.

### Hint for Reporter Cat

Maybe Reporter Cat had used this keyboard when his blog [reportercat.xyz](https://reportercat.xyz/) was created by some computer guy. And the computer guy helped Reporter Cat set a password for the blog to hide some reports.
