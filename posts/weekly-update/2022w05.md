## Purrnelope’s Country Club Weekly Update: week of January 31st 2022

Our very own [Carlini](https://twitter.com/Carlini8N?s=20) has lost it. Really lost it this time. He’s still giving away NFTs at an alarming rate. For goodness sake [he gave 5.6 ETH worth of purrs (using current floor value of 0.28 ETH)](https://twitter.com/Carlini8N/status/1489744713527840770) to [Vest.pcc.eth](https://twitter.com/avestaa) and he keeps going!

He’s also rambling on and on about how he eats, sleeps, drinks, and bathes with $TOKEN. Maybe if you — yes, you — went and gave him some ideas about what you’d want to spend $TOKEN on he’d finally get some rest!

    everyday. <br /><br />I will be rolling all the previously unrolled tweets
    tomorrow. <br /><br />Can you solve the yielding token sink?<br /><br />Make
    my life easy plz<br /><br />What would you spend a token you yielded on from
    an NFT, instead of dumping for eth?
