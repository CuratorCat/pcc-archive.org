Guides for .pcc.eth ENS Subdomains

## General Guides

### Claim .pcc.eth ENS (name your Cat)

- To claim your .pcc.eth subdomain, you have to own a [PCC Cat](../collections/cats/index.md) without a name.
- Connect your wallet at [purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens):

1. Choose a Cat you would like to name;
2. Type a name, 0-1, a-z are allowed;
3. Click Claim, and confirm with your wallet.

- Once the transaction is complete on blockchain, you have your .pcc.eth subdomain with your cat.

### Set Primary ENS Record

- Once you have a cat with a name, you can link your wallet to use that .pcc.eth subdomain.
- Connect your wallet at [purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens):

1. Choose a pcc.eth subdomain name;
2. Click Apply, and confirm with your wallet.

### Transfer .pcc.eth ENS to Another Wallet

- **The .pcc.eth subdomain follows the Cat. If you want to transfer your .pcc.eth subdomain to another wallet address, simply transfer the cat has that name to the wallet you want to use.**
- e.g. Cat #7926 has the `curatorcat.pcc.eth` subdomain name. Transfer Cat #7926 to another wallet will make `curatorcat.pcc.eth` resolve to the new wallet address.

- After the transfer, you have to _Set Primary ENS Record_ again if you want to use the name as primary in the new wallet.
