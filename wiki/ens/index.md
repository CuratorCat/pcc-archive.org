The PCC owns **purrnelopescountryclub.eth** and **pcc.eth** ENS.

## `.pcc.eth` ENS Subdomains

All Purr holders are now eligible to claim a Purrnelope's Country Club sub-domain. 

E.g. Carlini8's ENS Subdomain is **carlini8.pcc.eth**. And it will display the cat as the ENS Profile Picture as well. See [eth.xyz/carlini8.pcc.eth](https://eth.xyz/carlini8.pcc.eth), [opensea.io/carlini8.pcc.eth](https://opensea.io/carlini8.pcc.eth)

## Subdomain FAQ {#faq}

### When will I be eligible?

Every Purr holder is now eligible to claim.

### Does it override if I have an existing .eth domain?

You can have as many inbound addresses as you like, so an extra subdomain does not remove or replace your .eth domain. Papa was `peteronfire78.eth` & Papa still is. However, if you set your subdomain.pcc.eth  as your primary address, this will be the address that shows on Uniswap, Opens, Snapshot, etc. Your avatar will also be your Purr rather than the generic MetaMask image! 

### How do I get mine?

Head to PCC website or this link here: https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens

### Why doesn’t it show on UniSwap/OS?

If your subdomain.pcc.eth doesn’t show on Uniswap - please ensure you completed the second transaction on our website 
If it shows on Uniswap but not OpenSea yet, its most likely (99.9%) that it’s OpenSea being slow! It will sort itself out eventually! 

### I still have questions!

Tag Papa `peteronfire78#0016` in the PCC Discord Server or DM Papa - Papa's DMs are open to anyone in PCC Discord Server.
