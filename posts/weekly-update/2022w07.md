# Purrnelopeâ€™s Country Club Weekly Update: week of February 14th 2022

Last Saturday a hacker executed a phishing scam which affected 32 wallets and stole 254 NFTs. This tweet thread is a good technical rundown of how the hacker executed the scam:

In laymanâ€™s terms, NFT holders were tricked into signing a message which authorized the hacker to buy the usersâ€™ NFTs. On Saturday the hacker utilized those approvals to transfer NFTs to their own wallet and then sell the NFTs. A great way to protect yourself is to understand what you are signing and what to expect when you interact with websites.

While our future is bright it is helpful to look backwards every once in a while. This is what Carlini sent as the original mock up for the Purrnelope Country Club NFT art:
