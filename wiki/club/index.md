The merchandise was planned since Roadmap V1, and the team is currently working hard on the merch. Some merch will require redeem using [Purrks](../collections/kittyvault-purrks/index.md) NFTs to redeem, e.g. Hoodies, 3D Model, Comic Book, Music Record, Keyboard and Ledger Nano S.

## Games

Games are planned in [Roadmap V2](/posts/2022/02/25/post/roadmap-2-0-6-months-on-from-launch). Currently the Team is working with Entity Builds developing the first game in the NFT Worlds metaverse. Entity Builds is a best-in-class studio with incredible Minecraft builders, devs and designers.
