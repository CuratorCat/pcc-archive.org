## Purrnelopeâ€™s Country Club Weekly Update: week of May 9th 2022

Remember that nightstand we airdropped to you a bit ago? You can now use those NFTs to redeem the latest Purrnelope Country Club companion, the Grandma! Go [here](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/grandma) to claim your Grandmas for free! Yes, it is an on-chain transaction so you will pay some gas but donâ€™t worry, there is no rush (yet). Claiming is open until June 13th!

Thatâ€™s not the only website update we had in store this week, we added our [merch store](https://store.purrnelopescountryclub.com/)! Now you can show off your web3 community in real life! Choose from hats, shirts, and even a GM mug for when you need a special pick me up in the morning!
