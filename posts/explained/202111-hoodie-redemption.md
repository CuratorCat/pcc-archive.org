With all these baskets being airdropped you may be forgiven for forgetting about last months airdrop! An update on where we are: The Team Hoodies are currently with the screen printers, after this they’ll be sent to IYK to inject the NFT magic into them, before reaching the Team for quality assurance. We want to make sure these hoodies reach our high standards before letting you trade in KittyBank tokens for them! 

Once we’re happy with them, we will launch the claim section of the website for those of you who wish to FLEX!
