Shout out to Katie for another _incredible_ video about the January airdrop! Those dance moves are the cat’s meow :) We cannot wait to unleash these beats on the public once it’s ready to go!

I hope you have the big screen fired up because we have yet another video for you to check out and this one’s from the heart. We asked you all what you love about the purrs and you delivered! Thank you for all of the kind words everyone, [#WeLoveThePurrs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeLoveThePurrs)!

Shout out to [Alex3422_NftNoob](https://opensea.io/Alex3422_NftNoob) for collecting a new Gold purr for 10Ξ bringing their collection up to 29 purrs. Thank you for your support!
