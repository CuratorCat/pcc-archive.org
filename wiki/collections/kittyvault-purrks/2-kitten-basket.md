This Kitten Basket NFT can be redeemed for a [Kitten Companion](../kittens/index.md). 1 Kitten per 1 Basket you own. The Kitten will be able to redeem the KittyBank token in the future, not this Basket, the Kitten you can claim with it. For 2 weeks this token can be solely traded or hodl'd. After the two weeks, claiming of the Kittens will be live, this will be live for 1 month. After that 1 month period (6 weeks from dispatch of the Baskets), PCC Team will pull all of these Baskets back. You will miss the opportunity to claim your Kitten after 6 weeks.

Claimed Kittens represent fractional ownership of the KittyVault.

## Redeem
