**Exclusively** in our discord we hosted the great [Jay Stansfield](https://twitter.com/jaystansfield) who shared some demos of the songs featured on our vinyl airdrop and they sound awesome! But that‚Äôs not all, Jay also started writing a song featuring our collectors‚Äô personal Purrs!

Last and certainly not least we offer the warmest welcome to Chooch74! They joined our team recently and will lead our Business Development & Strategy helping us grow like never before. Look out for some big moves from us in 2022 :)

That‚Äôs all for now,

Mini Meow!
