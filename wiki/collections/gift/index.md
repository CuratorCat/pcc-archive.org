A reward for PCC's first Ambassadors after sticking around after we stopped our profile picture payment program. Back in his NFTBoxes days Carlini8 worked a lot with bananakin and he loves his work, it is truly excellent. This piece represents advertising via profile pictures, to show you rep the Purr.

### Diamond Claws Cat

The Diamond Claws Gift is a thank you for believing in PCC project. The willingness not to sell really does mean a lot to PCC and PCC Team thanks everyone for joining us on this journey. PCC will do their best to ensure that the faith is rewarded, starting with this NFT drawn by PCC's in house artist 1rregularCharlie to show the team's appreciation!
