# .pcc.eth ENS Subdomains

![](./assets/pcc-ens.jpg)

You can only have a **.pcc.eth** if you own a Purrnelopes Country Club [Cat](../collections/cats/index.md). The ENS is tied to the cat, not an additional NFT, not your wallet, the cat itself. If you sell your PCC Cat, the **.pcc.eth** goes with it.

It's free for PCC Cats holders to claim on [PCC website](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens) beside the gas. As long as you hold the cat tied to it, you will have your **.pcc.eth** ENS, the PCC Team pays the annual fees for the primary **pcc.eth** ENS.

ENS domains is booming, and PCC's wizard `hodl.pcc.eth` created a custom [ENS resolver contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b6d20f524367d7e98ed849d37fc662402dca7fb#code) that made PCC the first project links ERC-721 NFTs to ENS subdomains possible. The contract itself says _feel free to reuse_ for other projects to use!

## FAQ for .pcc.eth ENS {#faq}

### 1. How do I get mine?

- You have to own a PCC Cat, and the cat must not haven't claimed a .pcc.eth subdomain before..
- PCC Official Claim Page: [purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens).

### 2. Do I own that .pcc.eth ENS?

- **No, your cat owns it**.

- But you own the cat, so technically you own the .pcc.eth in a way as long as you have the cat.

### 3. Rules and restricitons?

- **A cat can be named once**, and the name follows the cat, so if you sell your cat, you'll lose that **.pcc.eth** ENS.

- **The name of the cat can not be changed or transferred** for now.

- **Each wallet address can only name 1 cat in every 12 weeks** for now. It's defined by `reset_period` in the [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b6d20f524367d7e98ed849d37fc662402dca7fb#readContract).

  If you want to name multiple cats and don't want to wait, name them using different wallet addresses, and send them back to the wallet you'd like to hold them.

- **Name length or special characters?**

  - Well, **only `0-1` and `a-z` are allowed**.

  - **The name can be any length** e.g. `x.pcc.eth` is possible but it is already taken.

### 4. How to know if a Cat has been named? {#faq-check}

The correct way is to look on the blockchain. You can lookup the PCC ENS Resolver contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b6d20f524367d7e98ed849d37fc662402dca7fb#readContract):

Another quicker way is to lookup on [PCC ENS on Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/curatorcat/pcc-ens). Enter cat ID in the search box. But it is not always up-to-date with Dune, it's just easier and faster than Etherscan. If you want to buy a Cat with no name, use Etherscan.

### 5. Does it override if I have an existing .eth domain?

No. You can have as many inbound addresses as you like, so an extra subdomain does not remove or replace your .eth domain. However, if you set your subdomain.pcc.eth as your primary address, this will be the address that shows on Uniswap, OpenSea, Snapshot, etc. Your avatar will also be your Purr rather than the generic MetaMask image!

### 6. Why doesn’t it show on UniSwap/OS?

**You have to set your subdomain.pcc.eth as the primary name**

This can be done on the [claim page](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/claim/ens) once you have a cat owns a name:

If it shows on Uniswap but not OpenSea yet, its most likely (99.9%) that it’s OpenSea being slow! It will sort itself out eventually! You can also connect your wallet on https://app.ens.domains/ to see if it's working.
