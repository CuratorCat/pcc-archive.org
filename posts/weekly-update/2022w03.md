Welcome to the weekly update from Purrnelope’s Country Club for the week commencing January 17th, 2022!

Many of you have wondered about those comic cats that we sent to Cat holders on New Year’s Eve. Well, this ERC-1155 will be redeemable for a **physical** comic! That physical comic contains clues…

… clues about what you ask?

**_MURDER!_**

There has been a murder at the Country Club and there are several suspects. The answers to this mystery lie within the physical comic. Redeem your comic cat for the physical and work together to find the culprit!
