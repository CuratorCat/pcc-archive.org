## General

**The KittyVault** is a vault of NFTs that backs every [**PCC Cat**](../collections/cats/index.md) & [**KV Purrks airdrops**](../collections/kittyvault-purrks/index.md). It used to use the name _Kitty Bank_[^1].

The idea is that the Vault will operate as a 'Gold Standard' so your PCC collections will always have some inherent worth.

### The Fractionalization

The whole KittyVault collection will be fractionalized with [fractional.art](https://fractional.art) 2.0 [^2]. The Team will do this once the team can ensure the fractional.art vault can still receive tokens, airdrops, etc. There are many projects in there that have upcoming companions, airdrops, tokens, etc. and we want those benefits to come to the Vault for everyone's benefit.

### KVCoin

Each Cat and each KittyVault Purrks airdrops (8 in total) will be able to be redeemed for one KVCoin. That KVCoin will be tradable for 1/100,000 of the Vault's value.

:::info

**The KVCoin**, aka KittyVault Token, is different from the $TOKEN. It has not been released by PCC Team, its formal name, functions, etc. may also change before the release.

## FAQ

### Who lives in the KittyVault?

- **CryptoPunks, CyberKongz, Bored Apes, Cool Cats, Stoner Cats, Purrs and more.**

  You can browse the KittyVault: [on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/kittyvault.pcc.eth), [with VR onyber.io](https://oncyber.io/spaces/RKJMFEwiVG8f6V1aPL08).

### Is the Vault Fractionlized?

- **Not yet**

### Which Collections can claim KVCoin?

> this section needs to be cited

- **Cats, 8 KV Purrks Airdrops, Kittens, Companion 2**

  However, KV Purrks airdrop No.2's metadata says: `"Kitty Bank": "No"`, because the airdroped Kitten Baskets are used to claim Kittens, and Kittens are fractions of KV.

### How does the KittyVault grow in value?

- The aim is to buy NFTs that we believe are either undervalued or a very solid long-term hold[^3]. Read more on [Deflationary NFTs and Rewarding HODLing](/posts/2021/08/15/post/deflationary-nfts-and-rewarding-hodling-kittybank).

### How is KV funded?

- The KittyVault buys NFT with company ETH, primary and secondary sales.

### How are the Airdrops received in KV being managed?

- **With Community Vote**. The KittyVault receives airdrops from some of the NFTs it holds, like $Banana, $APE, and ESSENCE Claim.

  How they are used/spent is done by community vote, see [all Vote on PCC's Website](https://www.purrnelopescountryclub.com/voting).
