Airdrop 8 is here! We sent out the final companion, THE GRANDMA! You have the placeholder in your wallet (check your hidden folder on OpenSea) and be awareâ€¦ you have 2 weeks to trade or hodl your placeholder NFT before we open minting for the companions. Click here to learn more from Katieâ€™s grandma!

I canâ€™t let you get away without reading about Hodlâ€™s new impostor bot! This bot tells you how many people are gaming the system on twitter with .pcc.eth and helps you unfollow them! We have over 700 registered ENS subdomains and we have so much more to come!

Thatâ€™s all for now, mini meow!
